You and Anara agree that the requirements of this Dispute Resolution section will apply even to disagreements that may have arisen before you accepted these Terms. You must send the Demand to the Notice Address. Anara must send the Demand to you via certified mail to the most recent address Anara has on file for you (or by email if Anara only has an email address for you on file). A Demand (1) shall seek to resolve a Dispute only on an individual basis; (2) shall state the full basis for the Dispute (including the details about the Dispute sufficient for the recipient to review and respond) and the date that the Dispute arose; (3) shall provide the individual claimant&rsquo;s full name, phone number, and email address to confirm their identity and to aid communication; and (4) shall be personally signed by the individual claimant or for Anara by its authorized representative (and not only their counsel). Within twenty (20) business days of receipt of a Demand, the recipient may request an individualized video or telephone conference to attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute which both you and Anara will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). You and Anara agree that you and Anara will not take any legal action, including filing a lawsuit or demanding arbitration, until after the period to request a conference expires or, if a conference is requested, twenty (20) business days after the individualized conference is completed. Compliance with this informal dispute resolution procedure section is mandatory and a condition precedent to initiating any lawsuit or arbitration. This procedure is essential to providing each of us a meaningful opportunity to resolve Disputes informally. Any applicable limitations periods and filing fee deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in the process set forth above. A court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of a lawsuit or arbitration if these requirements have not been met.</span>

<span data-as="p">You and Anara agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and Anara agree otherwise or the Mass Arbitration provisions set forth below are triggered, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person&rsquo;s or party&rsquo;s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party&rsquo;s individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect any other person or party. You and Anara further agree that in the event this arbitration agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, the prohibitions on class and representative actions and non-individualized relief set forth in this paragraph are severable and shall apply to any claim between you and Anara in any forum.

<span data-as="p">If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Demands or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against Anara, and such circumstances meet the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (&ldquo;Mass Filing&rdquo;) set forth in National Arbitration &amp; Mediation&rsquo;s (&ldquo;NAM&rdquo;) Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (&ldquo;NAM&rsquo;s Mass Filing Rules&rdquo;) available at <a href="https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="link">https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/</a>), you and Anara agree that JAMS shall not serve as arbitrator and that instead NAM shall administer any Mass Filing claims and the NAM Mass Filing Rules in effect at the time such claim is filed shall apply as modified below. The parties agree to the appointment of a Procedural Arbitrator pursuant to NAM&rsquo;s Mass Filing Rules, and additionally agree that the Procedural Arbitrator will have the authority to determine jurisdiction and arbitrability including, but not limited to, any issue regarding the validity, existence, formation or scope of the agreement under which Arbitration is being sought, and the proper parties to the Arbitration. You agree that throughout this process, the parties&rsquo; counsels shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. You acknowledge and agree that your election to participate in a Mass Filing may result in a delay in the adjudication of your dispute with Anara.  Any applicable limitations periods and filing fee deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in the process set forth below.</span>
<span data-as="p"><strong>Stage One:</strong> Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Anara shall each select 15 claims per side (30 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Anara will pay the mediator&rsquo;s fee.</span>
<span data-as="p"><strong>Stage Two:</strong> If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Anara shall each select 20 claims per side (40 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Anara will pay the mediator&rsquo;s fee.</span>
<span data-as="p">If your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process identified above, either:</span>
<span data-as="p"><strong>Option One:</strong> You and we may separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with these Terms. You may opt out of arbitration by sending us your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out by certified mail addressed to the Notice Address. Such an opt-out notice must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of Stage Two or the elective mediation associated with Stage Two. We may opt your claim out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of our intention to opt out to your counsel within 14 days after the expiration of your 30-day opt out period. Counsels for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.</span>
<span data-as="p"><strong>OR</strong></span>
<span data-as="p"><strong>Option Two:</strong> If neither you nor we elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsels for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims will be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims will not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor will any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsels for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator, as such term is used in the NAM Rules) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.</span>
<span data-as="p">You and Anara agree that each party values the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wishes to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between the parties. You and Anara acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases. If any part of this Mass Arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the NAM rules, then the balance of this Mass Arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision was not contained herein unless the lack of such provision would lead this Mass Arbitration provision to fail of its essential purpose.</span>
<span data-as="p">A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim will proceed before JAMS pursuant to the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines (available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="link">https://www.jamsadr.com/mass-arbitration-procedures</a>). If a court of competent jurisdiction also determines that the JAMS Mass Arbitration Procedures and Guidelines are not enforceable as to your Claim, then the remaining Claims shall be subject to Option One or Option Two above as selected by you or us.</span>
