        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="muted">Last updated: September 18, 2025</p>

        <p>DuNorth (“we”, “us”, or “our”) helps students connect their own Canvas account to DuNorth so they can access their course information and study tools in one place. This policy describes what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account information</strong>: name, email you provide during sign‑up or Google Sign‑In.</li>
          <li><strong>School selection</strong>: the Canvas base URL for your institution (e.g., <code>https://example.instructure.com</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Authentication status</strong>: when you click “Refresh Canvas” on the DuNorth site, our Chrome extension reads your Canvas sign‑in cookie for your Canvas site and sends it to your DuNorth account over HTTPS so our server can call the Canvas API on your behalf.</li>
          <li><strong>Canvas content you choose to sync</strong>: courses, assignments, pages, files metadata and extracted text, announcements. We do not scrape page HTML; we use the Canvas REST API and signed file URLs.</li>
          <li><strong>Service logs</strong>: timestamps, request metadata, IP address (standard server logs) to operate and secure the service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How we use information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Confirm your Canvas sign‑in and connect your DuNorth account.</li>
          <li>Fetch and display your own course data via the Canvas API.</li>
          <li>Provide study features (chat answers, summaries) on top of your content.</li>
          <li>Maintain security, prevent abuse, and improve reliability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Chrome extension</h2>
        <p>The DuNorth extension is narrowly scoped. It has access to Canvas domains only and uses the <strong>cookies</strong> permission to read your Canvas sign‑in cookie for your Canvas host. It transmits that cookie to your DuNorth account over HTTPS only when you initiate a sync from the DuNorth website. The extension does not scrape pages, track browsing, or share data with third parties.</p>

        <h2>Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell or share your data with third parties for advertising. We may use trusted service providers (e.g., hosting, databases) bound by confidentiality to operate the service.</p>

        <h2>Retention & deletion</h2>
        <p>Canvas session information is short‑lived and refreshed as needed. Synced course data is retained until you delete it or close your account. You can request deletion at any time.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We use HTTPS, access controls, and industry‑standard safeguards to protect data. No method is 100% secure, but we continuously improve our protections.</p>

        <h2>Your choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Disconnect or resync your Canvas account at any time.</li>
          <li>Delete specific synced items or your entire account.</li>
          <li>Contact us for data access or deletion requests.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>DuNorth is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided us information, contact us to remove it.</p>
