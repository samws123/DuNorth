        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="muted">Last updated: September 18, 2025</p>

        <p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your use of DuNorth (“DuNorth”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and the DuNorth Chrome extension (the “Extension”). By using DuNorth, you agree to these Terms and our <a href="/privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You must be at least 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your region) to use DuNorth.</li>
          <li>You are responsible for the accuracy of information you provide and for maintaining the security of your account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
        <p>DuNorth helps you connect your own Canvas account so you can access your course information and study tools in one place. When you click “Refresh Canvas” on the DuNorth website, the Extension confirms your Canvas sign‑in and securely forwards a session token to your DuNorth account so our server can call the Canvas REST API on your behalf. DuNorth does not scrape Canvas pages.</p>

        <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use DuNorth only in accordance with your institution’s policies and applicable law.</li>
          <li>Do not upload, copy, or share content you do not have the right to use.</li>
          <li>Do not attempt to circumvent rate limits, security, or access controls.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Content</h2>
        <p>You may sync and upload content (e.g., course materials, extracted text). You retain your rights in your content. You grant DuNorth a limited license to store, process, and display that content solely to provide the service to you. You are responsible for the content you choose to sync or upload.</p>

        <h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>DuNorth integrates with third‑party services such as Canvas, cloud hosting, and AI providers. Your use of those services may be subject to their terms. We are not responsible for third‑party services.</p>

        <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No illegal activity, infringement, or harassment.</li>
          <li>No reverse engineering, automated scraping, or interfering with the service.</li>
          <li>No sharing or selling access to your account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>DuNorth and its logos, features, and software are owned by us or our licensors. Except for the limited rights expressly granted, we reserve all rights.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes & Availability</h2>
        <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features at any time. We will attempt to provide advance notice of material changes when reasonable.</p>

        <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>DuNorth is provided “as is” and “as available.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement. We do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of synced or extracted content.</p>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, DuNorth and its affiliates will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, or for lost profits, revenues, or data. Our aggregate liability for all claims relating to the service will not exceed the amounts you paid to DuNorth (if any) in the 12 months before the claim.</p>

        <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless DuNorth from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising from your use of the service or violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Termination</h2>
        <p>You may stop using DuNorth at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access if you violate these Terms or if required by law or institutional policy. Upon termination, we may delete your data in accordance with our policies.</p>

        <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to conflict of laws rules. Venue and jurisdiction lie in courts located in Delaware, USA.</p>

        <h2>14. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the new Terms on this page and update the “Last updated” date.</p>
